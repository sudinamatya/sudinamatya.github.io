  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img class ="img" src= "MyPic.jpg" alt="Me">
  <p>	I am Senior at the University of Maryland studying Information Science with a minor in Statistics. 
     After graduating I plan on pursuing a career in Data Science in any industry that I find fitting for me. 
     As a data scientist I want to help organizations make good decisions by providing key insights from their data. 
     Aside from academics, I've been involved in the Nepalese Student Assocation since entering college. I served as Vice President
	for two years and helped elevate the organization to new heights. In terms of professional experience, I am currently 
	interning under the Data and Analytics team at Precision Strategies, a political consulting firm in D.C. I intend to 
	turn this internship into a memorable expereince through which I make strong connections and develop new Data Science skills.</p>
